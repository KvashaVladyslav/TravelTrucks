Main Idea: Create a website for ordering trucks for vacations. TravelTrucks is a
web application designed to help users easily find and rent trucks for their
vacations. Whether you're looking for a mobile home, food truck, or a vehicle
equipped with amenities like air conditioning, a kitchen, or a bathroom,
TravelTrucks lets you filter and browse through a variety of trucks available
for rent. Users can search by location, type of vehicle, and specific features
to find the perfect match for their needs. The platform provides a seamless
experience for booking a truck, making it an ideal solution for anyone looking
to travel with comfort and flexibility.
